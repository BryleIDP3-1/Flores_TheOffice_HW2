            <h3 class="lb_heading"> Michael Scott - CEO</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">Michael Gary Scott was born March 15, 1965, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in "Dunder Mifflin Infinity" as Michael tells the camera crew he was held back from second-grade. In "Diversity Day", Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be "two-fifteenths" Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he despises. In "Nepotism", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit.</p>

            <p class="lb_text">He is loyal to the company and honestly tries to help his employees when he thinks they are having a problem. Michael has been at Dunder Mifflin (as of "Michael's Last Dundies") 9,986,000 minutes, which means that he has been working there since May 6, 1992.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading"> Dwight Shrute</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">Dwight is a former volunteer sheriff deputy,[8] but has to step down after breaking his pledge in order to help his boss, Michael, illegally pass a drug test by giving him his urine in the episode "Drug Testing". He is also a notary public; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's beet farm, alongside his cousin, Mose. Dwight has affinities for paintball, Battlestar Galactica, ping pong, survivalism, Goju Ryu karate,[9] and weapons. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of cars behind the driver because it is the safest location in a car. He takes Karate very seriously, gaining a black belt in season 9. He was also "Senpai" to the Sensei of the Dojo in which he took part in. He is also faster than a Black Pepper snake, known as a speckled kingsnake.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading"> Jim Halpert</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">James "Jim" Halpert (born October 1, 1978) is a fictional character in the U.S. version of the television sitcom The Office, who is portrayed by John Krasinski. The character is based on Tim Canterbury from the original version of The Office. The character is also named after a childhood friend of executive producer Greg Daniels. He is introduced as a sales representative at the Scranton branch of paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, before temporarily transferring to the Stamford branch in the third season. Upon the merger of Scranton and Stamford branches, he becomes Assistant Regional Manager, and later co-manager alongside Michael Scott during the sixth-season episode arc from "The Promotion" to "Manager and Salesman".</p>
            
            <p class="lb_text">His character serves as the intelligent, mild-mannered straight man role to Michael, although it is also defined by a rivalrous pranking on fellow salesman Dwight Schrute and a romantic interest in receptionist Pam Beesly, whom he begins dating in the fourth season, marries in the sixth, and has children with in the sixth and eighth. Jim's coworker, Andy Bernard, who transferred from the Stamford branch, often calls him by the nickname "Big Tuna".</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading"> Pam Beesly</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">Pamela Morgan "Pam" Halpert (n√©e Beesly; born March 25, 1979) is a fictional character on The Office, who is played by Jenna Fischer. Her counterpart in the original UK series of The Office is Dawn Tinsley. Her character is initially the receptionist at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, before becoming a saleswoman and eventually office administrator until she left in the series finale. Her character is shy, growing assertive but amiable, and artistically inclined, and shares a romantic interest with Jim Halpert, whom she begins dating in the fourth season, and eventually, marries and starts a family with as the series continues.</p>
            
            <p class="lb_text">From her years working the front desk, Pam has become well-acquainted with the Dunder-Mifflin staff and is consistently shown to have a thorough understanding of her coworkers' personalities, including the more eccentric individuals Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott. She uses this familiarity to manipulate them, often for their and the company's best interests (such as her giving the staff elaborate instructions on how to handle a heartbroken Michael in "The Chump") but also occasionally for her own. This familiarity plays a large part in her efficiency as office administrator and was crucial to her being promoted to the previously non-existent position.</p>

        <article>
            <h3 class="lb_heading"> Meredith Palmer</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">Meredith has two kids. Her son, Jake, lives with her ("Take Your Daughter to Work Day"). Her daughter, Wendy ("the good one"), lives with her ex-husband ("The Accountants: Meredith"). In the episode "Take Your Daughter to Work Day", she brings her son, who has been suspended from school. In season one, it is mentioned Meredith has been divorced twice. As it is not mentioned beyond season one, it is unclear whether it was the same man both times.</p>
            
            <p class="lb_text">Meredith has an alcohol problem that sometimes affects her job performance. In one episode she passes out with her head on her desk. In another, after a party in the office, she's so drunk she removes her top in front of Michael in his office after everyone else has left. Michael responds by taking a deep breath/sigh then taking a quick picture. In "Moroccan Christmas", she gets so drunk that she lights her hair on fire. Michael stages an intervention and tries to check her into a rehabilitation clinic, but they do not accept unwilling patients.</p>

        <article>
            <h3 class="lb_heading"> Ryan Howard</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">Ryan Bailey Howard is an American salesman, former receptionist, and convicted fraudster who works at Dunder Mifflin. He was a temporary employee until he is promoted as Vice President of Sales. However, David Wallace demotes him when the Michael Scott Paper Company is acquired by Dunder Mifflin. He also worked at the Michael Scott Paper Company until the acquisition. Ryan was convicted of fraud for misleading the shareholders of Dunder Mifflin, and was arrested. However, he was released and required to do community service.</p>
            
            <p class="lb_text">Throughout the series, Ryan changes his persona every year beginning with the third season. When offered a job for Corporate in the season 3 finale, Ryan relocates to New York City and adopts a nouveau riche persona: becoming extroverted, growing a beard, wearing nice suits, and getting $200 haircuts. But he subsequently ends up partying hard and getting addicted to drugs and alcohol. His downfall culminates in misleading Dunder-Mifflin's shareholders via his website's sales numbers, effectively committing fraud as Oscar Martinez later claims.</p>
